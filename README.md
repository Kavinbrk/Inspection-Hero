# Inspection-Hero
A wireframe developed for a upcoming workfied mobile game
Main Branch: main
This branch will hold the final version of the project once all phases are completed and tested.

Development Branch: develop
The develop branch is the primary working branch where active development takes place. It branches out into feature branches for each specific task.

Branches and Commit Messages:
Branch: feature/purpose-definition

Commit 1: feat: Define problem and objectives for the prototype
Clearly outlined the problem addressed by the prototype.
Defined objectives for testing core mechanics and evaluating user engagement.

Merging Process:
After completing each feature branch, merge it into the develop branch using pull requests (PRs) to ensure proper code review and testing.
Once all features are complete and tested, merge the develop branch into the main branch.
